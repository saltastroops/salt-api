# SALT API

!!! danger
    The SALT API was originally developed as part of another project, and the documentation still needs to be updated to reflect the fact that it is a stand-alone project, as some information is outdated.

The SALT API gives access to proposals for the [Southern African Large Telescope (SALT)](https://www.salt.ac.za).
