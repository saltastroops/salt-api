    Request to receive the existing and all future log entries and status changes.

    After connecting to this endpoint you must send a message with a valid JWT token
    authenticating you. This is a token returned by the `/token` endpoint, as you would
    use in the `Authorization` header for other (HTTP) endpoints. If the token sent is
    invalid, the connection is closed with the closing code 1011.

    You must have created a submission in order to view its log or status. If another
    user has created it, the connection is closed with the closing code 1011.

    If the specified submission identifier does not exist, the connection is closed with
    the closing code 1011.

    Yoy may optionally specify a minimum entry number from which onwards to return log
    entries. Use the `from-entry-number` query parameter for this. For example, if you
    are only interested in status changes, you could choose a `from-entry-number` like
    100000.

    When you connect to this endpoint (and have sent a valid token), the current status
    and the existing log entries are sent. The endpoint checks the database every few
    seconds for new log entries or status changes, and it returns a JSON object with
    the current status (irrespective of whether it has changed or not) and the list of
    new log entries (or an empty list if there are no new entries). Here are two
    examples with two and no new log entries, respectively:

           "log_entries: [

                   "logged_at": "2022-05-03T08:16:56+00:00",

       {
           "status": "In progress",
            "log_entries": []
       }

    If the submission is successful, a JSON object is sent which in addition includes
    the proposal code:

    .. code-block:: json
       {
           "status": "Successful",
           "log_entries": [
               {

                   "logged_at": "2022-05-03T08:17:34+00:00",

           ],
           "proposal_code": "2022-1-SCI-042"

    The entry_number of a log entry is a running number for a submission. In other
    words, the n-th log entry created for a submission has the entry number n.
